wind3_fill is the fully three-dimensional wind solver that includes the 
continuity equation and a small amount of filtering of the solution when
determining the cost function.  Thus the solution loosely satifies the 
continuity equation (a tight solution is not conducive to producing the
winds closest to reality).  Satisfying continuity very closely is not 
even possible since the discretization only approaches a solution to the 
continuity equation.  A "correction" can be applied later to exactly 
satisfy the discretized continuity equation if a budget is desired.

This is more of a research program than wind0, and wind_interpolate is
probably a better choice than wind_interpolate0 if you want to experiment
with a range of radii of influence when interpolating Doppler radials.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON 19 JUNE 2003:  I have added a line to the job file that 
allows you to increase the weight given to the continuity equation, since I 
have found that the equation often has regions many points across where the 
sign of the error of the continutity equation solution is the same and the 
magnitude approaches .001 /s.  This is not good when such contiguous regions
 of error of the same sign exist.  A value of 1000. is found to be good in
the FAST cases through Hurricane Humberto (2001), and even then the 
Doppler projection equations only have an error around 1 m/s rms, approximately
the expected rms error in the observations themselves.  This parameter may now
be changed.
