   c 8 character identifier for flight mission or whatever you want to put
   c there

OLIVIA SEP25
   c experiment identifier of up to 28 characters

   c Number of radars/uf files that will be interpolated

/data/users/gamache/swp.42/ufd.940925205800.TA42P3.0.tape
   c Name of uf file from radar 1
   c
210000 211300
   c Start and end time of data in seconds since midnight (end time may go
   c over 240000)  Suggest you use 000000 999999 to get all the data in the
   c uf file.  Less time can be used to pick and choose times you want to 
   c interpolate from uf file

/data/users/gamache/swp.42/SUMFILE_42_1_05
   c Name of interpolation output file from interpolation of uf file 1

   c Name of uf file from radar 2

   c Time of interpolation for uf file from radar 2 (see note for radar 1)
   c
/data/users/gamache/swp.43/SUMFILE_43_1_05
   c Name of uf file for radar 2
   c
   c There may be more repeats of the above 3 lines if there are more than
   c two radars
   c
1. 4.
   c Cell/radar-target motion.  Used to composite radar data relative to a
   c moving weather system
   c
210630
   c Time around which to composite data.  Data obtained before this time
   c is "advected" forward to account for the storm motion, and data
   c obtained after this time is "advected" rearward also to account for
   c storm motion
   c
19.040 -120.061
   c Lat/lon of reference point within analysis domain
   c
1. 1. 1.
   c x, y, and z grid resolution in analysis domain
   c
40. 40. 0. 0.
   c First two entries show the location of the lat/lon reference point given
   c above within the analysis domain relative to the lower left corner
   c
80 80 17
   c number of grid points in analysis in the x, y, and z dimensions
   c
1. 1.
   c horizontal and vertical max distances from grid point for an
   c observation to be included in the interpolation
   c
.5 .5
   c horizontal and vertical e-folding distances for gaussian weight applied 
   c to an observation in the interpolation
   c
VU
   c name in the uf file for the unfolded velocity data
   c
DB
   c name in the uf file for the radar reflectivity data
   c
0
   c will a pseudo-bilinear interpolation (value=1) be used instead of a 
   c gaussian distance-weighted interpolation (value not equal to 1)
   c In either case all grid points that are not surrounded in all eight 
   c directions from the grid point will be flagged to make sure only
   c interpolation, and not extrapolation are being done to the 
   c interpolated Doppler radials
