   c Line 1 is a flight (date) identifier that can be whatever 8 character 
   c identifier you want
   c
OLIVIA SEP25
   c Line 2 is a longer identifier describing the experiment or data set up to 
   c 28? characters

   c Line 3 the number of different uf files available, generally the number of
   c different radars observing the same analysis region
   c
214300 214827
   c Line 4 times for beginning and end of interpolation for radar 1 
   c that will end up in the
   c descriptor headers of final wind analysis
   c
/data/users/gamache/uf_test_results/SUMFILE_42_test
   c path and name of uf data set for radar 1
   c
214200 214827
   c repeated for uf file/radar 2
   c
/data/users/gamache/uf_test_results/SUMFILE_43_test
   c also repeated for second radar.
   c
   c above two lines will be repeated with different paramaters for each
   c radar over two radars
   c

0. 0. 0. 0.
   c distance of lat/lon reference point in x and y from lower left corner
   c comprise the first two entries
   c height of surface above sea level (over ocean this should be zero)
   c last entry is clockwise rotation of y axis from north, e.g. if the
   c rotation is 45, the y axis of the analysis actually pointing to the NE

   c x, y and z dimensions of analysis grid (total pts in the case shown being

   c the single value above is the weight given to the continuity equation 
   c constraint.  A value suggested by the math is 1., but my experience
   c is that there are enough systematic errors in the solution of the 
   c continuity equation that 1000. is my suggested starting value, but you 
   c play with that weight if you want.
   c If you play I suggest varying by orders of magnitude
1. 1.
   c height of melting level in km, width of melting band in km
   c
20. 30.
   c DBZ1 and DBZ2--Above melting band if DBZ<DBZ1 fallspeed is for snow
   c if DBZ1<DBZ<DBZ2 linear interpolation between snow and rain fallspeeds
   c if DBZ>DBZ2 fallspeed is for rain even though above melting band
   c another linear interpolation is applied over the above one when the
   c observation is within the melting band
   c
wind3_fill.w
   c Name of output wind file from program wind0
5.0E-05
   c Value of the convergence parameter where you stop execution and write 
   c out the wind file. If you think your wind field variational solution has
   c not converged enough you can lower this number.  If you think you can get
   c just as good a solution with less iterations, increase this number (by 2
   c times, 5 times, or 10 times)
